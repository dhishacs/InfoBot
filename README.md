A three-layer neural network is used for processing language. It is implemented in PyTorch. NLP techniques like tokenization and stemming are used. They convert input sentences to a bag-of-words representation. Responses are dynamically generated based on model predictions. Predefined intents are selected using confidence-based criteria.
