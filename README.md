# Dialog-MLP Chatbot Project
## Overview
Welcome to the Dialog-MLP Chatbot project! This initiative employs a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) to comprehend and generate responses based on patterns learned from input-output sequences. Primarily designed for chat settings, the MLP is trained on self-collected data to offer contextually relevant and engaging interactions.

## Key Features
**MLP Training**: The project harnesses the power of Multi-layer Perceptron, a neural network model, to learn and understand dialogue patterns.

**Data Collection**: We've curated a dataset to train the MLP, ensuring diverse and contextually rich input-output sequences for an enhanced chatbot experience.

**Contextual Responses**: The MLP's training enables it to provide contextually relevant responses, making the chatbot more conversational and engaging.


## Why Dialog-MLP Chatbot?
**User-Centric Conversations**:
Enjoy meaningful and contextually aware conversations with the chatbot, making interactions more human-like and engaging.

**Flexible Deployment**:
The trained MLP model can be easily deployed for various applications, from customer support to virtual assistants.

**Continuous Learning**:
The chatbot is designed to continuously learn and adapt to new dialogue patterns, ensuring its responsiveness to evolving conversations.
